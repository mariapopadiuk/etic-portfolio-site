Portugal is probably the country with the most beautiful beaches in Europe. It is a fantastic destination for beach-lovers. There is plenty of sandy shores, rocky cliffs and spectacular views to choose from. One thing I have noticed since I have been living in Portugal, that plasctic is everywhere, human influence has become an issue and unfortunatly plastic is an integral part of it. My mindset is "If you want change world, start from yourself", as me and my friend Isabella are beach lovers we decided to start clean up placeces we are visiting, after some post in social networks a lot of our friends decided help us and this moviment started to gain rotations. Beach clean up can reduce litter, protect our ocean and raise awareness about litter and plastic pollution. Our volunteer moviment conducts beach cleanups throughout north Alcochete coas, and in one clean up can be collected almost 200kg of garbage, but that does not mean this place stay clean, because in about a month the water brings garbage there.

        essential products utilize plastic materials to make your life easier and more straightforward.</p>

      <p class="table-text">Plastic isn’t as simple as you may think. Each one of them is different from the others.
        Some of them are reusable, the others produce hazardous material after several uses. Some are easily recyclable,
        others need more sophisticated and intricate handlings in its recycling process.
      Take your nearest plastic product, maybe the lunch box you brought from home, your water bottle, your instant
      noodle cup. Study closely, and you might find a number at its back or bottom.</p>
